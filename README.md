# Code refactor challenge 

## introduction
 In this bootcamp challenge, we were tasked with taking a pre-made landing page and making it accessible, 
 in order to do this, I had to change the HTML to make it semantic then refactor CSS code to make it link 
 with the new HTML. I added ALT tags to all images and commented out redundant CSS.

## Technologies
Project is created with HTML AND CSS

## Image of web page
